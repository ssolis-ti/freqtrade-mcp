## Pairlists and Pairlist Handlers

Pairlist Handlers define the list of pairs (pairlist) that the bot should trade. They are configured in the `pairlists` section of the configuration settings.

In your configuration, you can use Static Pairlist (defined by the [`StaticPairList`](#static-pair-list) Pairlist Handler) and Dynamic Pairlist (defined by the [`VolumePairList`](#volume-pair-list), [`CrossMarketPairList`](#crossmarketpairlist), [`MarketCapPairlist`](#marketcappairlist) and [`PercentChangePairList`](#percent-change-pair-list) Pairlist Handlers).

Additionally, [`AgeFilter`](#agefilter), [`DelistFilter`](#delistfilter), [`PrecisionFilter`](#precisionfilter), [`PriceFilter`](#pricefilter), [`ShuffleFilter`](#shufflefilter), [`SpreadFilter`](#spreadfilter) and [`VolatilityFilter`](#volatilityfilter) act as Pairlist Filters, removing certain pairs and/or moving their positions in the pairlist.

If multiple Pairlist Handlers are used, they are chained and a combination of all Pairlist Handlers forms the resulting pairlist the bot uses for trading and backtesting. Pairlist Handlers are executed in the sequence they are configured. You can define either `StaticPairList`, `VolumePairList`, `ProducerPairList`, `RemotePairList`, `MarketCapPairList`, `PercentChangePairList` or `CrossMarketPairList` as the starting Pairlist Handler.

Inactive markets are always removed from the resulting pairlist. Explicitly blacklisted pairs (those in the `pair_blacklist` configuration setting) are also always removed from the resulting pairlist.

### Pair blacklist

The pair blacklist (configured via `exchange.pair_blacklist` in the configuration) disallows certain pairs from trading.
This can be as simple as excluding `DOGE/BTC` - which will remove exactly this pair.

The pair-blacklist does also support wildcards (in regex-style) - so `BNB/.*` will exclude ALL pairs that start with BNB.
You may also use something like `.*DOWN/BTC` or `.*UP/BTC` to exclude leveraged tokens (check Pair naming conventions for your exchange!)

> **📌 Testing pairlists**
>
> Pairlist configurations can be quite tricky to get right. Best use freqUI in [webserver mode](../freq-ui/#webserver-mode) or the [`test-pairlist`](../utils/#test-pairlist) utility sub-command to test your Pairlist configuration quickly.

#### Static Pair List

By default, the `StaticPairList` method is used, which uses a statically defined pair whitelist from the configuration. The pairlist also supports wildcards (in regex-style) - so `.*/BTC` will include all pairs with BTC as a stake.

It uses configuration from `exchange.pair_whitelist` and `exchange.pair_blacklist`, which in the below example, will trade BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT - and will prevent BNB/USDT trading.

Both `pair_*list` parameters support regex - so values like `.*/USDT` would enable trading all pairs that are not in the blacklist.

```
"exchange": {
    "name": "...",
    // ... 
    "pair_whitelist": [
        "BTC/USDT",
        "ETH/USDT",
        // ...
    ],
    "pair_blacklist": [
        "BNB/USDT",
        // ...
    ]
},
"pairlists": [
    {"method": "StaticPairList"}
],
```

By default, only currently enabled pairs are allowed.
To skip pair validation against active markets, set `"allow_inactive": true` within the `StaticPairList` configuration.
This can be useful for backtesting expired pairs (like quarterly spot-markets).

When used in a "follow-up" position (e.g. after VolumePairlist), all pairs in `'pair_whitelist'` will be added to the end of the pairlist.

#### Volume Pair List

`VolumePairList` employs sorting/filtering of pairs by their trading volume. It selects `number_assets` top pairs with sorting based on the `sort_key` (which can only be `quoteVolume`).

When used in the chain of Pairlist Handlers in a non-leading position (after StaticPairList and other Pairlist Filters), `VolumePairList` considers outputs of previous Pairlist Handlers, adding its sorting/selection of the pairs by the trading volume.

When used in the leading position of the chain of Pairlist Handlers, the `pair_whitelist` configuration setting is ignored. Instead, `VolumePairList` selects the top assets from all available markets with matching stake-currency on the exchange.

The `refresh_period` setting allows to define the period (in seconds), at which the pairlist will be refreshed. Defaults to 1800s (30 minutes).
The pairlist cache (`refresh_period`) on `VolumePairList` is only applicable to generating pairlists.
Filtering instances (not the first position in the list) will not apply any cache (beyond caching candles for the duration of the candle in advanced mode) and will always use up-to-date data.

`VolumePairList` is per default based on the ticker data from exchange, as reported by the ccxt library:

- The `quoteVolume` is the amount of quote (stake) currency traded (bought or sold) in last 24 hours.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "sort_key": "quoteVolume",
        "min_value": 0,
        "max_value": 8000000,
        "refresh_period": 1800
    }
],
```

You can define a minimum volume with `min_value` - which will filter out pairs with a volume lower than the specified value in the specified timerange.
In addition to that, you can also define a maximum volume with `max_value` - which will filter out pairs with a volume higher than the specified value in the specified timerange.

##### VolumePairList Advanced mode

`VolumePairList` can also operate in an advanced mode to build volume over a given timerange of specified candle size. It utilizes exchange historical candle data, builds a typical price (calculated by (open+high+low)/3) and multiplies the typical price with every candle's volume. The sum is the `quoteVolume` over the given range. This allows different scenarios, for a more smoothened volume, when using longer ranges with larger candle sizes, or the opposite when using a short range with small candles.

For convenience `lookback_days` can be specified, which will imply that 1d candles will be used for the lookback. In the example below the pairlist would be created based on the last 7 days:

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "sort_key": "quoteVolume",
        "min_value": 0,
        "refresh_period": 86400,
        "lookback_days": 7
    }
],
```

> **📌 Range look back and refresh period**
>
> When used in conjunction with `lookback_days` and `lookback_timeframe` the `refresh_period` can not be smaller than the candle size in seconds. As this will result in unnecessary requests to the exchanges API.

> **📌 Performance implications when using lookback range**
>
> If used in first position in combination with lookback, the computation of the range based volume can be time and resource consuming, as it downloads candles for all tradable pairs. Hence it's highly advised to use the standard approach with `VolumeFilter` to narrow the pairlist down for further range volume calculation.

Unsupported exchanges

On some exchanges (like Gemini), regular VolumePairList does not work as the api does not natively provide 24h volume. This can be worked around by using candle data to build the volume.
To roughly simulate 24h volume, you can use the following configuration.
Please note that These pairlists will only refresh once per day.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "sort_key": "quoteVolume",
        "min_value": 0,
        "refresh_period": 86400,
        "lookback_days": 1
    }
],
```

More sophisticated approach can be used, by using `lookback_timeframe` for candle size and `lookback_period` which specifies the amount of candles. This example will build the volume pairs based on a rolling period of 3 days of 1h candles:

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "sort_key": "quoteVolume",
        "min_value": 0,
        "refresh_period": 3600,
        "lookback_timeframe": "1h",
        "lookback_period": 72
    }
],
```

> **📌 Note**
>
> `VolumePairList` does not support backtesting mode.

#### Percent Change Pair List

`PercentChangePairList` filters and sorts pairs based on the percentage change in their price over the last 24 hours or any defined timeframe as part of advanced options. This allows traders to focus on assets that have experienced significant price movements, either positive or negative.

**Configuration Options**

- `number_assets`: Specifies the number of top pairs to select based on the 24-hour percentage change.
- `min_value`: Sets a minimum percentage change threshold. Pairs with a percentage change below this value will be filtered out.
- `max_value`: Sets a maximum percentage change threshold. Pairs with a percentage change above this value will be filtered out.
- `sort_direction`: Specifies the order in which pairs are sorted based on their percentage change. Accepts two values: `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order.
- `refresh_period`: Defines the interval (in seconds) at which the pairlist will be refreshed. The default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
- `lookback_days`: Number of days to look back. When `lookback_days` is selected, the `lookback_timeframe` is defaulted to 1 day.
- `lookback_timeframe`: Timeframe to use for the lookback period.
- `lookback_period`: Number of periods to look back at.

When PercentChangePairList is used after other Pairlist Handlers, it will operate on the outputs of those handlers. If it is the leading Pairlist Handler, it will select pairs from all available markets with the specified stake currency.

`PercentChangePairList` uses ticker data from the exchange, provided via the ccxt library:
The percentage change is calculated as the change in price over the last 24 hours.

Unsupported exchanges

On some exchanges (like HTX), regular PercentChangePairList does not work as the api does not natively provide 24h percent change in price. This can be worked around by using candle data to calculate the percentage change. To roughly simulate 24h percent change, you can use the following configuration. Please note that these pairlists will only refresh once per day.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "PercentChangePairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "min_value": 0,
        "refresh_period": 86400,
        "lookback_days": 1
    }
],
```

**Example Configuration to Read from Ticker**

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "PercentChangePairList",
        "number_assets": 15,
        "min_value": -10,
        "max_value": 50
    }
],
```

In this configuration:

1. The top 15 pairs are selected based on the highest percentage change in price over the last 24 hours.
2. Only pairs with a percentage change between -10% and 50% are considered.

**Example Configuration to Read from Candles**

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "PercentChangePairList",
        "number_assets": 15,
        "sort_key": "percentage",
        "min_value": 0,
        "refresh_period": 3600,
        "lookback_timeframe": "1h",
        "lookback_period": 72
    }
],
```

This example builds the percent change pairs based on a rolling period of 3 days of 1-hour candles by using `lookback_timeframe` for candle size and `lookback_period` which specifies the number of candles.

The percent change in price is calculated using the following formula, which expresses the percentage difference between the current candle's close price and the previous candle's close price, as defined by the specified timeframe and lookback period:

\[ Percent Change = (\frac{Current Close - Previous Close}{Previous Close}) \* 100 \]

> **📌 Range look back and refresh period**
>
> When used in conjunction with `lookback_days` and `lookback_timeframe` the `refresh_period` can not be smaller than the candle size in seconds. As this will result in unnecessary requests to the exchanges API.

Hence it's highly advised to use the standard approach with `PercentChangePairList` to narrow the pairlist down for further percent-change calculation.

> **📌 Backtesting**
>
> `PercentChangePairList` does not support backtesting mode.

#### ProducerPairList

With `ProducerPairList`, you can reuse the pairlist from a [Producer](../producer-consumer/) without explicitly defining the pairlist on each consumer.

[Consumer mode](../producer-consumer/) is required for this pairlist to work.

The pairlist will perform a check on active pairs against the current exchange configuration to avoid attempting to trade on invalid markets.

You can limit the length of the pairlist with the optional parameter `number_assets`. Using `"number_assets"=0` or omitting this key will result in the reuse of all producer pairs valid for the current setup.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "ProducerPairList",
        "number_assets": 5,
        "producer_name": "default",
    }
],
```

> **📌 Combining pairlists**
>
> This pairlist can be combined with all other pairlists and filters for further pairlist reduction, and can also act as an "additional" pairlist, on top of already defined pairs.
> `ProducerPairList` can also be used multiple times in sequence, combining the pairs from multiple producers.
> Obviously in complex such configurations, the Producer may not provide data for all pairs, so the strategy must be fit for this.

#### RemotePairList

It allows the user to fetch a pairlist from a remote server or a locally stored json file within the freqtrade directory, enabling dynamic updates and customization of the trading pairlist.

The RemotePairList is defined in the pairlists section of the configuration settings. It uses the following configuration options:

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "RemotePairList",
        "mode": "whitelist",
        "processing_mode": "filter",
        "pairlist_url": "https://example.com/pairlist",
        "number_assets": 10,
        "refresh_period": 1800,
        "keep_pairlist_on_failure": true,
        "read_timeout": 60,
        "bearer_token": "my-bearer-token",
        "save_to_file": "user_data/filename.json" 
    }
]
```

The optional `mode` option specifies if the pairlist should be used as a `blacklist` or as a `whitelist`. The default value is "whitelist".

The optional `processing_mode` option in the RemotePairList configuration determines how the retrieved pairlist is processed. It can have two values: "filter" or "append". The default value is "filter".

The optional `number_assets` option in the RemotePairList configuration determines how many pairs will be returned if used in whitelist `mode`. By default, all pairs will be returned. In blacklist `mode`, this option will be ignored.

In "filter" mode, the retrieved pairlist is used as a filter. Only the pairs present in both the original pairlist and the retrieved pairlist are included in the final pairlist. Other pairs are filtered out.

In "append" mode, the retrieved pairlist is added to the original pairlist. All pairs from both lists are included in the final pairlist without any filtering.

The `pairlist_url` option specifies the URL of the remote server where the pairlist is located, or the path to a local file (if file:/// is prepended). This allows the user to use either a remote server or a local file as the source for the pairlist.

The `save_to_file` option, when provided with a valid filename, saves the processed pairlist to that file in JSON format. This option is optional, and by default, the pairlist is not saved to a file.

Multi bot with shared pairlist example

`save_to_file` can be used to save the pairlist to a file with Bot1:

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "RemotePairList",
        "mode": "whitelist",
        "pairlist_url": "https://example.com/pairlist",
        "number_assets": 10,
        "refresh_period": 1800,
        "keep_pairlist_on_failure": true,
        "read_timeout": 60,
        "save_to_file": "user_data/filename.json" 
    }
]
```

This saved pairlist file can be loaded by Bot2, or any additional bot with this configuration:

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "RemotePairList",
        "mode": "whitelist",
        "pairlist_url": "file:///user_data/filename.json",
        "number_assets": 10,
        "refresh_period": 10,
        "keep_pairlist_on_failure": true,
    }
]
```

The user is responsible for providing a server or local file that returns a JSON object with the following structure:

```
{
    "pairs": ["XRP/USDT", "ETH/USDT", "LTC/USDT"],
    "refresh_period": 1800
}
```

The `pairs` property should contain a list of strings with the trading pairs to be used by the bot. The `refresh_period` property is optional and specifies the number of seconds that the pairlist should be cached before being refreshed.

The optional `keep_pairlist_on_failure` specifies whether the previous received pairlist should be used if the remote server is not reachable or returns an error. The default value is true.

The optional `read_timeout` specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the remote source, The default value is 60.

The optional `bearer_token` will be included in the requests Authorization Header.

> **📌 Note**
>
> In case of a server error the last received pairlist will be kept if `keep_pairlist_on_failure` is set to true, when set to false a empty pairlist is returned.

#### MarketCapPairList

`MarketCapPairList` employs sorting/filtering of pairs by their marketcap rank based of CoinGecko. The returned pairlist will be sorted based of their marketcap ranks if used in whitelist `mode`.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "MarketCapPairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "max_rank": 50,
        "refresh_period": 86400,
        "mode": "whitelist",
        "categories": ["layer-1"]
    }
]
```

`number_assets` defines the maximum number of pairs returned by the pairlist if used in whitelist `mode`. In blacklist `mode`, this setting will be ignored.

`max_rank` will determine the maximum rank used in creating/filtering the pairlist. It's expected that some coins within the top `max_rank` marketcap will not be included in the resulting pairlist since not all pairs will have active trading pairs in your preferred market/stake/exchange combination.  
While using a `max_rank` bigger than 250 is supported, it's not recommended, as it'll cause multiple API calls to CoinGecko, which can lead to rate limit issues.

The `refresh_period` setting defines the interval (in seconds) at which the marketcap rank data will be refreshed. The default is 86,400 seconds (1 day). The pairlist cache (`refresh_period`) applies to both generating pairlists (when in the first position in the list) and filtering instances (when not in the first position in the list).

The `mode` setting defines whether the plugin will filters in (whitelist `mode`) or filters out (blacklist `mode`) top marketcap ranked coins. By default, the plugin will be in whitelist mode.

The `categories` setting specifies the [coingecko categories](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories) from which to select coins from. The default is an empty list `[]`, meaning no category filtering is applied.
If an incorrect category string is chosen, the plugin will print the available categories from CoinGecko and fail. The category should be the ID of the category, for example, for `https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-1`, the category ID would be `layer-1`. You can pass multiple categories such as `["layer-1", "meme-token"]` to select from several categories.

Coins like 1000PEPE/USDT or KPEPE/USDT:USDT are detected on a best effort basis, with the prefixes `1000` and `K` being used to identify them.

> **📌 Many categories**
>
> Each added category corresponds to one API call to CoinGecko. The more categories you add, the longer the pairlist generation will take, potentially causing rate limit issues.

> **📌 Duplicate symbols in coingecko**
>
> Coingecko often has duplicate symbols, where the same symbol is used for different coins. Freqtrade will use the symbol as is and try to search for it on the exchange. If the symbol exists - it will be used. Freqtrade will however not check if the *intended* symbol is the one coingecko meant. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially on low volume coins or with meme coin categories.

#### CrossMarketPairList

Generate or filter pairs based of their availability on the opposite market.

The `pairs_exist_on` setting defines whether the pairs should exists on both spot and futures market (`both_markets`) or only exist on the specified trading mode (`current_market_only`). By default, the plugin will be in `both_markets` setting, which means whitelisted pairs have to exists on both spot and futures markets.

#### AgeFilter

Removes pairs that have been listed on the exchange for less than `min_days_listed` days (defaults to `10`) or more than `max_days_listed` days (defaults `None` mean infinity).

When pairs are first listed on an exchange they can suffer huge price drops and volatility
in the first few days while the pair goes through its price-discovery period. Bots can often
be caught out buying before the pair has finished dropping in price.

This filter allows freqtrade to ignore pairs until they have been listed for at least `min_days_listed` days and listed before `max_days_listed`.

#### DelistFilter

Removes pairs that will be delisted on the exchange maximum `max_days_from_now` days from now (defaults to `0` which remove all future delisted pairs no matter how far from now). Currently this filter only supports following exchanges:

> **📌 Available exchanges**
>
> Delist filter is available on Bybit Futures, Bitget Futures and Binance, where Binance Futures will work for both dry and live modes, while Binance Spot is limited to live mode (for technical reasons).

> **📌 Backtesting**
>
> `DelistFilter` does not support backtesting mode.

#### FullTradesFilter

Shrink whitelist to consist only in-trade pairs when the trade slots are full (when `max_open_trades` isn't being set to `-1` in the config).

When the trade slots are full, there is no need to calculate indicators of the rest of the pairs (except informative pairs) since no new trade can be opened. By shrinking the whitelist to just the in-trade pairs, you can improve calculation speeds and reduce CPU usage. When a trade slot is free (either a trade is closed or `max_open_trades` value in config is increased), then the whitelist will return to normal state.

When multiple pairlist filters are being used, it's recommended to put this filter at second position directly below the primary pairlist, so when the trade slots are full, the bot doesn't have to download data for the rest of the filters.

> **📌 Backtesting**
>
> `FullTradesFilter` does not support backtesting mode.

#### OffsetFilter

Offsets an incoming pairlist by a given `offset` value.

As an example it can be used in conjunction with `VolumeFilter` to remove the top X volume pairs. Or to split a larger pairlist on two bot instances.

Example to remove the first 10 pairs from the pairlist, and takes the next 20 (taking items 10-30 of the initial list):

```
"pairlists": [
    // ...
    {
        "method": "OffsetFilter",
        "offset": 10,
        "number_assets": 20
    }
],
```

> **📌 Warning**
>
> When `OffsetFilter` is used to split a larger pairlist among multiple bots in combination with `VolumeFilter`
> it can not be guaranteed that pairs won't overlap due to slightly different refresh intervals for the
> `VolumeFilter`.

> **📌 Note**
>
> An offset larger than the total length of the incoming pairlist will result in an empty pairlist.

#### PairInformationFilter

Filters pairs based on the presence of certain information in the ccxt markets argument.

To get the correct field - you can use the following code snippet to print the market information for a given pair, and find the correct field and value to filter for:

```
import ccxt
from pprint import pprint
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'options': {'defaultType': 'swap'} 
    })
lm = exchange.load_markets()
pprint(lm['XAU/USDT:USDT'])
```

```
{
    "id": "XAUUSDT",
    "lowercaseId": "xauusdt",
    "symbol": "XAU/USDT:USDT",
    "base": "XAU",
    "quote": "USDT",
    "settle": "USDT",
    "baseId": "XAU",
    "quoteId": "USDT",
    "settleId": "USDT",
    "type": "swap",
    // ...
    "info": {
        "symbol": "XAUUSDT",
        "pair": "XAUUSDT",
        "contractType": "TRADIFI_PERPETUAL",
        "deliveryDate": 4133404800000,
        "onboardDate": 1765440300000,
        "status": "TRADING",
        // ...
    }
}
```

As the highlighted lines show, the `contractType` field in the `info` section of the market data contains the value `TRADIFI_PERPETUAL`, which can be used to filter for TradeFi perpetual contracts.
Nested dictionaries can be accessed by using dot notation in the `info_key` - so the `contractType` field can be accessed with `info.contractType`.

In this example, the resulting `PairInformationFilter` configuration will include pairs that have `TRADIFI_PERPETUAL` as their `contractType` in the `info` section of the market data.

```
[
    // ...
    {
        "method": "PairInformationFilter",
        "selection_mode": "whitelist",  // can be whitelist or blacklist
        "info_key" : "info.contractType", // can be any key in market data
        "info_compare_value": "TRADIFI_PERPETUAL", // can be any matching value
    }
]
```

#### PerformanceFilter

Sorts pairs by past trade performance, as follows:

1. Positive performance.
2. No closed trades yet.
3. Negative performance.

Trade count is used as a tie breaker.

You can use the `minutes` parameter to only consider performance of the past X minutes (rolling window).
Not defining this parameter (or setting it to 0) will use all-time performance.

The optional `min_profit` (as ratio -> a setting of `0.01` corresponds to 1%) parameter defines the minimum profit a pair must have to be considered.
Pairs below this level will be filtered out.
Using this parameter without `minutes` is highly discouraged, as it can lead to an empty pairlist without a way to recover.

```
"pairlists": [
    // ...
    {
        "method": "PerformanceFilter",
        "minutes": 1440,  // rolling 24h
        "min_profit": 0.01  // minimal profit 1%
    }
],
```

As this Filter uses past performance of the bot, it'll have some startup-period - and should only be used after the bot has a few 100 trades in the database.

#### PrecisionFilter

Filters low-value coins which would not allow setting stoplosses.

Namely, pairs are blacklisted if a variance of one percent or more in the stop price would be caused by precision rounding on the exchange, i.e. `rounded(stop_price) <= rounded(stop_price * 0.99)`. The idea is to avoid coins with a value VERY close to their lower trading boundary, not allowing setting of proper stoploss.

> **📌 PrecisionFilter is pointless for futures trading**
>
> The above does not apply to shorts. And for longs, in theory the trade will be liquidated first.

> **📌 Backtesting**
>
> `PrecisionFilter` does not support backtesting mode using multiple strategies.

#### PriceFilter

The `PriceFilter` allows filtering of pairs by price. Currently the following price filters are supported:

- `min_price`
- `max_price`
- `max_value`
- `low_price_ratio`

The `min_price` setting removes pairs where the price is below the specified price. This is useful if you wish to avoid trading very low-priced pairs.
This option is disabled by default, and will only apply if set to > 0.

The `max_price` setting removes pairs where the price is above the specified price. This is useful if you wish to trade only low-priced pairs.
This option is disabled by default, and will only apply if set to > 0.

The `max_value` setting removes pairs where the minimum value change is above a specified value.
This is useful when an exchange has unbalanced limits. For example, if step-size = 1 (so you can only buy 1, or 2, or 3, but not 1.1 Coins) - and the price is pretty high (like 20$) as the coin has risen sharply since the last limit adaption.
As a result of the above, you can only buy for 20$, or 40$ - but not for 25$.
On exchanges that deduct fees from the receiving currency (e.g. binance) - this can result in high value coins / amounts that are unsellable as the amount is slightly below the limit.

The `low_price_ratio` setting removes pairs where a raise of 1 price unit (pip) is above the `low_price_ratio` ratio.
This option is disabled by default, and will only apply if set to > 0.

For `PriceFilter` at least one of its `min_price`, `max_price` or `low_price_ratio` settings must be applied.

Calculation example:

Min price precision for SHITCOIN/BTC is 8 decimals. If its price is 0.00000011 - one price step above would be 0.00000012, which is ~9% higher than the previous price value. You may filter out this pair by using PriceFilter with `low_price_ratio` set to 0.09 (9%) or with `min_price` set to 0.00000011, correspondingly.

> **📌 Low priced pairs**
>
> Low priced pairs with high "1 pip movements" are dangerous since they are often illiquid and it may also be impossible to place the desired stoploss, which can often result in high losses since price needs to be rounded to the next tradable price - so instead of having a stoploss of -5%, you could end up with a stoploss of -9% simply due to price rounding.

#### ShuffleFilter

Shuffles (randomizes) pairs in the pairlist. It can be used for preventing the bot from trading some of the pairs more frequently then others when you want all pairs be treated with the same priority.

By default, ShuffleFilter will shuffle pairs once per candle.
To shuffle on every iteration, set `"shuffle_frequency"` to `"iteration"` instead of the default of `"candle"`.

```
    {
        "method": "ShuffleFilter", 
        "shuffle_frequency": "candle",
        "seed": 42
    }
```

> **📌 Tip**
>
> You may set the `seed` value for this Pairlist to obtain reproducible results, which can be useful for repeated backtesting sessions. If `seed` is not set, the pairs are shuffled in the non-repeatable random order. ShuffleFilter will automatically detect runmodes and apply the `seed` only for backtesting modes - if a `seed` value is set.

#### SpreadFilter

Removes pairs that have a difference between asks and bids above the specified ratio, `max_spread_ratio` (defaults to `0.005`).

Example:

If `DOGE/BTC` maximum bid is 0.00000026 and minimum ask is 0.00000027, the ratio is calculated as: `1 - bid/ask ~= 0.037` which is `> 0.005` and this pair will be filtered out.

#### RangeStabilityFilter

Removes pairs where the difference between lowest low and highest high over `lookback_days` days is below `min_rate_of_change` or above `max_rate_of_change`. Since this is a filter that requires additional data, the results are cached for `refresh_period`.

In the below example:
If the trading range over the last 10 days is <1% or >99%, remove the pair from the whitelist.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "RangeStabilityFilter",
        "lookback_days": 10,
        "min_rate_of_change": 0.01,
        "max_rate_of_change": 0.99,
        "refresh_period": 86400
    }
]
```

Adding `"sort_direction": "asc"` or `"sort_direction": "desc"` enables sorting for this pairlist.

> **📌 Tip**
>
> This Filter can be used to automatically remove stable coin pairs, which have a very low trading range, and are therefore extremely difficult to trade with profit.
> Additionally, it can also be used to automatically remove pairs with extreme high/low variance over a given amount of time.

#### VolatilityFilter

Volatility is the degree of historical variation of a pairs over time, it is measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic daily returns. Returns are assumed to be normally distributed, although actual distribution might be different. In a normal distribution, 68% of observations fall within one standard deviation and 95% of observations fall within two standard deviations. Assuming a volatility of 0.05 means that the expected returns for 20 out of 30 days is expected to be less than 5% (one standard deviation). Volatility is a positive ratio of the expected deviation of return and can be greater than 1.00. Please refer to the wikipedia definition of [`volatility`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)).

This filter removes pairs if the average volatility over a `lookback_days` days is below `min_volatility` or above `max_volatility`. Since this is a filter that requires additional data, the results are cached for `refresh_period`.

This filter can be used to narrow down your pairs to a certain volatility or avoid very volatile pairs.

In the below example:
If the volatility over the last 10 days is not in the range of 0.05-0.50, remove the pair from the whitelist. The filter is applied every 24h.

```
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "VolatilityFilter",
        "lookback_days": 10,
        "min_volatility": 0.05,
        "max_volatility": 0.50,
        "refresh_period": 86400
    }
]
```

Adding `"sort_direction": "asc"` or `"sort_direction": "desc"` enables sorting mode for this pairlist.

### Full example of Pairlist Handlers

The below example blacklists `BNB/BTC`, uses `VolumePairList` with `20` assets, sorting pairs by `quoteVolume`, then filter future delisted pairs using [`DelistFilter`](#delistfilter) and [`AgeFilter`](#agefilter) to remove pairs that are listed less than 10 days ago. After that [`PrecisionFilter`](#precisionfilter) and [`PriceFilter`](#pricefilter) are applied, filtering all assets where 1 price unit is > 1%. Then the [`SpreadFilter`](#spreadfilter) and [`VolatilityFilter`](#volatilityfilter) are applied and pairs are finally shuffled with the random seed set to some predefined value.

```
"exchange": {
    "pair_whitelist": [],
    "pair_blacklist": ["BNB/BTC"]
},
"pairlists": [
    {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "number_assets": 20,
        "sort_key": "quoteVolume"
    },
    {
        "method": "DelistFilter",
        "max_days_from_now": 0,
    },
    {"method": "AgeFilter", "min_days_listed": 10},
    {"method": "PrecisionFilter"},
    {"method": "PriceFilter", "low_price_ratio": 0.01},

    {
        "method": "RangeStabilityFilter",
        "lookback_days": 10,
        "min_rate_of_change": 0.01,
        "refresh_period": 86400
    },
    {
        "method": "VolatilityFilter",
        "lookback_days": 10,
        "min_volatility": 0.05,
        "max_volatility": 0.50,
        "refresh_period": 86400
    },
    {"method": "ShuffleFilter", "seed": 42}
],
```

## Protections

Protections will protect your strategy from unexpected events and market conditions by temporarily stop trading for either one pair, or for all pairs.
All protection end times are rounded up to the next candle to avoid sudden, unexpected intra-candle buys.

> **📌 Usage tips**
>
> Not all Protections will work for all strategies, and parameters will need to be tuned for your strategy to improve performance.
>
> Each Protection can be configured multiple times with different parameters, to allow different levels of protection (short-term / long-term).

> **📌 Backtesting**
>
> Protections are supported by backtesting and hyperopt, but must be explicitly enabled by using the `--enable-protections` flag.

### Available Protections

- [`StoplossGuard`](#stoploss-guard) Stop trading if a certain amount of stoploss occurred within a certain time window.
- [`MaxDrawdown`](#maxdrawdown) Stop trading if max-drawdown is reached.
- [`LowProfitPairs`](#low-profit-pairs) Lock pairs with low profits
- [`CooldownPeriod`](#cooldown-period) Don't enter a trade right after selling a trade.

### Common settings to all Protections

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `method` | Protection name to use.   **Datatype:** String, selected from [available Protections](#available-protections) |
| `stop_duration_candles` | For how many candles should the lock be set?   **Datatype:** Positive integer (in candles) |
| `stop_duration` | how many minutes should protections be locked.  Cannot be used together with `stop_duration_candles`.   **Datatype:** Float (in minutes) |
| `lookback_period_candles` | Only trades that completed within the last `lookback_period_candles` candles will be considered. This setting may be ignored by some Protections.   **Datatype:** Positive integer (in candles). |
| `lookback_period` | Only trades that completed after `current_time - lookback_period` will be considered.  Cannot be used together with `lookback_period_candles`.  This setting may be ignored by some Protections.   **Datatype:** Float (in minutes) |
| `trade_limit` | Number of trades required at minimum (not used by all Protections).   **Datatype:** Positive integer |
| `unlock_at` | Time when trading will be unlocked regularly (not used by all Protections).   **Datatype:** string  **Input Format:** "HH:MM" (24-hours) |

> **📌 Durations**
>
> Durations (`stop_duration*` and `lookback_period*` can be defined in either minutes or candles).
> For more flexibility when testing different timeframes, all below examples will use the "candle" definition.

#### Stoploss Guard

`StoplossGuard` selects all trades within `lookback_period` in minutes (or in candles when using `lookback_period_candles`).
If `trade_limit` or more trades resulted in stoploss, trading will stop for `stop_duration` in minutes (or in candles when using `stop_duration_candles`, or until the set time when using `unlock_at`).

This applies across all pairs, unless `only_per_pair` is set to true, which will then only look at one pair at a time.

Similarly, this protection will by default look at all trades (long and short). For futures bots, setting `only_per_side` will make the bot only consider one side, and will then only lock this one side, allowing for example shorts to continue after a series of long stoplosses.

`required_profit` will determine the required relative profit (or loss) for stoplosses to consider. This should normally not be set and defaults to 0.0 - which means all losing stoplosses will be triggering a block.

The below example stops trading for all pairs for 4 candles after the last trade if the bot hit stoploss 4 times within the last 24 candles.

```
@property
def protections(self):
    return [
        {
            "method": "StoplossGuard",
            "lookback_period_candles": 24,
            "trade_limit": 4,
            "stop_duration_candles": 4,
            "required_profit": 0.0,
            "only_per_pair": False,
            "only_per_side": False
        }
    ]
```

> **📌 Note**
>
> `StoplossGuard` considers all trades with the results `"stop_loss"`, `"stoploss_on_exchange"` and `"trailing_stop_loss"` if the resulting profit was negative.
> `trade_limit` and `lookback_period` will need to be tuned for your strategy.

#### MaxDrawdown

The `MaxDrawdown` protection evaluates trades that closed within the current `lookback_period` (or `lookback_period_candles`).  
It supports 2 calculation modes:

- `calculation_mode: "ratios"` (default): Legacy approximation based on cumulative profit ratios.
- `calculation_mode: "equity"`: Standard peak-to-trough drawdown on the account equity curve, using starting balance and cumulative absolute profit.

With `calculation_mode: "ratios"`, drawdown is derived from cumulative trade profit ratios, not from the account equity curve. This is kept for backward compatibility and can differ from account-level drawdown when position sizing changes over time.

For new setups, `calculation_mode: "equity"` is recommended. Prefer `calculation_mode: "ratios"` only when you intentionally rely on legacy behavior, especially with fixed stake amount configurations where ratio-based behavior is easier to reason about.

If the observed drawdown exceeds `max_allowed_drawdown`, trading will stop for `stop_duration` after the last trade - assuming that the bot needs some time to let markets recover.

The below sample stops trading for 12 candles if max-drawdown is > 20% considering all pairs - with a minimum of `trade_limit` trades - within the last 48 candles. If desired, `lookback_period` and/or `stop_duration` can be used.

```
@property
def protections(self):
    return  [
        {
            "method": "MaxDrawdown",
            "calculation_mode": "equity",
            "lookback_period_candles": 48,
            "trade_limit": 20,
            "stop_duration_candles": 12,
            "max_allowed_drawdown": 0.2
        },
    ]
```

#### Low Profit Pairs

`LowProfitPairs` uses all trades for a pair within `lookback_period` in minutes (or in candles when using `lookback_period_candles`) to determine the overall profit ratio.
If that ratio is below `required_profit`, that pair will be locked for `stop_duration` in minutes (or in candles when using `stop_duration_candles`, or until the set time when using `unlock_at`).

For futures bots, setting `only_per_side` will make the bot only consider one side, and will then only lock this one side, allowing for example shorts to continue after a series of long losses.

The below example will stop trading a pair for 60 minutes if the pair does not have a required profit of 2% (and a minimum of 2 trades) within the last 6 candles.

```
@property
def protections(self):
    return [
        {
            "method": "LowProfitPairs",
            "lookback_period_candles": 6,
            "trade_limit": 2,
            "stop_duration": 60,
            "required_profit": 0.02,
            "only_per_pair": False,
        }
    ]
```

#### Cooldown Period

`CooldownPeriod` locks a pair for `stop_duration` in minutes (or in candles when using `stop_duration_candles`, or until the set time when using `unlock_at`) after exiting, avoiding a re-entry for this pair for `stop_duration` minutes.

The below example will stop trading a pair for 2 candles after closing a trade, allowing this pair to "cool down".

```
@property
def protections(self):
    return  [
        {
            "method": "CooldownPeriod",
            "stop_duration_candles": 2
        }
    ]
```

> **📌 Note**
>
> This Protection applies only at pair-level, and will never lock all pairs globally.
> This Protection does not consider `lookback_period` as it only looks at the latest trade.

### Full example of Protections

All protections can be combined at will, also with different parameters, creating a increasing wall for under-performing pairs.
All protections are evaluated in the sequence they are defined.

The below example assumes a timeframe of 1 hour:

- Locks each pair after selling for an additional 5 candles (`CooldownPeriod`), giving other pairs a chance to get filled.
- Stops trading for 4 hours (`4 * 1h candles`) if the last 2 days (`48 * 1h candles`) had 20 trades, which caused a max-drawdown of more than 20%. (`MaxDrawdown`).
- Stops trading if more than 4 stoploss occur for all pairs within a 1 day (`24 * 1h candles`) limit (`StoplossGuard`).
- Locks all pairs that had 2 Trades within the last 6 hours (`6 * 1h candles`) with a combined profit ratio of below 0.02 (<2%) (`LowProfitPairs`).
- Locks all pairs for 2 candles that had a profit of below 0.01 (<1%) within the last 24h (`24 * 1h candles`), a minimum of 4 trades.
